Frist Project python - price discount -  project 1 python Frist year college:

Write a Python program for a retail store that calculates a discount based on each customer’s age and the total amount spent on a product. The program should run in a loop to process multiple customers, and only stop when the user chooses to exit.

The store offers the following discounts:

1.	Age-based Discount: If the customer is below 18 years old, they get a 10% discount on the product price.
2.	Promotion: If the total price after the age-based discount is over €100, the customer receives an additional €10 discount.

Requirements:

1.	Use a while loop to allow multiple customer entries.
2.	Use input() to get the customer’s age and product price.
3.	Apply an if statement to determine eligibility for each discount.
4.	Display the final price and any discounts applied.
5.	After processing each customer, ask if the user wants to enter details for another customer. Exit if the answer is "no."




Second Project python - Blood Compatibility - project 2 python Frist year college:

You are tasked with creating a Python program to help educate patients at a local 
clinic about blood type compatibility. The program should:
 
Display a welcome message introducing the purpose of the program. 
Provide menu options for the user to: 
Use functions to perform compatibility checks for:
Implement error handling for invalid input 

Requirements: 
• Use at least one list to store blood types or compatibility data. 
• Use loops for user interaction until they choose to exit. 
• Use if-statements to handle user choices and compatibility logic. 
• Use functions to organize code into reusable blocks. 
• Provide clear and user-friendly output.

UX DESING PROJECTS:

Frist Project Figma - Wireframe Educational app -project 1 figma Frist year college :

Create a wireframe for an educational app. 
The app must focus on a specific task/skill and the main purpose of the app is to teach the user how to perform that task.Information: 
For this task you must create the wireframe screens of an educational app.
First, decide on the task or skill you want to focus on, for example: learn a new language/how to play a musical instrument/learn about history
Then, decide how you are going to give the user the information about the task or skill - what is going to be on the first screen of the app, what options are available to the user?
Make a list of everything your app can do, all the features and functions.
Sketch up a rough idea on paper, label areas appropriately.

Frist Project Figma - Design an interactive app prototype -project 2 figma Frist year college :

Design an interactive app prototype 
Using your Educational app wireframe from Assignment 1, design a high-fidelity prototype of it in Figma to incorporate: 
The design principles discussed during the course of this module for the overall design.
Clean page and element structure,  solid interaction design
You must develop the app's layout and design yourself, and then build the necessary screens that you would encounter when using the application. 
Finish the look and feel of the app, designing the brand logo, the layout, the typography styles, the patterns used (cards, image carousels, navigation menu's etc.) and the colour palette. 
Design the interaction model - add clickable areas. How will users interact with the app, how will we transition from screen to screen, will there be timed animation or other visual feedback to the user.
You will be evaluated on visual design, the usability and the perceived user experience of your app concept.
Your UI should be clean and consistent between screens, meaning:
