UX DESING PROJECTS:

Frist Project Figma - Wireframe Educational app -project 1 figma Frist year college :

Create a wireframe for an educational app. 
The app must focus on a specific task/skill and the main purpose of the app is to teach the user how to perform that task.Information: 
For this task you must create the wireframe screens of an educational app.
First, decide on the task or skill you want to focus on, for example: learn a new language/how to play a musical instrument/learn about history
Then, decide how you are going to give the user the information about the task or skill - what is going to be on the first screen of the app, what options are available to the user?
Make a list of everything your app can do, all the features and functions.
Sketch up a rough idea on paper, label areas appropriately.

Frist Project Figma - Design an interactive app prototype -project 2 figma Frist year college :

Design an interactive app prototype 
Using your Educational app wireframe from Assignment 1, design a high-fidelity prototype of it in Figma to incorporate: 
The design principles discussed during the course of this module for the overall design.
Clean page and element structure,  solid interaction design
You must develop the app's layout and design yourself, and then build the necessary screens that you would encounter when using the application. 
Finish the look and feel of the app, designing the brand logo, the layout, the typography styles, the patterns used (cards, image carousels, navigation menu's etc.) and the colour palette. 
Design the interaction model - add clickable areas. How will users interact with the app, how will we transition from screen to screen, will there be timed animation or other visual feedback to the user.
You will be evaluated on visual design, the usability and the perceived user experience of your app concept.
Your UI should be clean and consistent between screens, meaning:
